<!-- 
Traditionally, a meeting note includes:

[x] a title (e.g. "Pomodoro Timer First Brainstorm")
[x] subtitle for the meeting section/the topic of the meeting (e.g. "brainstorming", "check-ins", "documentation")
[x] subtitle for the date
[x] attendance list
[x] agenda of what the meeting will cover
[x] things that were unfinished business from last meeting
[x] things that are new business that need to be talked about
[x] any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
[x] pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were presented
        SWE meetings often have people diagram things on a whiteboard so we want those captured as well
[x] For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.
